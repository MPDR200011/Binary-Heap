# Wiki Structs

This repository contains implementations of various data structures using only their respective wikipedia pages as documentation.

There is an aim to test the behaviour of these data structures. One good thing about this is that the Unit Tests end up providing good usage examples.

This was made as a project to learn how various data structures function internally, so the performance or efeciency of the code might not be optimal. This might become a focus of the project in the future, however, the current aim is to implement as many structures as possible.

## Currently implemented

- Binary Heap ([Wikipedia papge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap))
- Fibonacci Heap ([Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap))
