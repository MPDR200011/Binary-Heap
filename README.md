##Binary Heap
Implemented push, peek, pop, size and empty methods.  
This Binary Heap uses a vector as an underlying structure.  
By default, uses a weak ordering function, so it will be a Minimum Binary Heap. But you can either:  
* Override the ordered type's < operator.
* Provide a function pointer to its constructor.

Accepts duplicates.
